When I die, bury me
Me in a grave,
In the wide steppe,
In a sweet land,
Where the fields are wide open,
And the Dnipro, and the cliffs
Could be seen and heard,
How the roaring river roars.

How it will carry from Ukraine
Into the blue sea
The enemy's blood... I'm over there
And the fields and the mountains
I will leave everything and go
To the very God
To pray... and before that
I don't know God.

Bury me and get up,
Break the chains
And with the enemy's evil blood
Sprinkle my freedom.

And me in a big family,
In a free, new family,
Do not forget to remember
With an unkind quiet word.
